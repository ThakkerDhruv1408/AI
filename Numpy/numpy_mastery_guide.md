# 🧠 1-Day NumPy Roadmap for AI/ML Engineers

---

##  **Foundation: Arrays & Basics**

### 🔹 Why NumPy Exists

* Python lists are **slow** and not built for **matrix math**.
* NumPy gives you **fast, memory-efficient, vectorized arrays** → the **language of ML**.
* In ML, *everything is vectors, matrices, and tensors*. NumPy is the **engine** behind it.

---

### 1. NumPy Arrays (the DNA of AI/ML)

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  # 1D array
mat = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2D array
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Features of a dataset → arrays
* Images → 3D arrays (H x W x Channels)
* Neural network weights → 2D/3D arrays

🔸 **Exercise:**

* Create a 1D array for `[2,4,6,8]`.
* Create a 2D array for a 3×3 identity matrix.

---

### 2. Array Properties

```python
print(arr.shape)  # (4,)
print(mat.shape)  # (2,2)
print(mat.ndim)   # 2 (2D array)
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Shape mismatches = **common bugs** in ML.
* Training data often needs reshaping.

🔸 **Exercise:**

* Check `shape` of a 3×3 matrix and a flattened version.

---

### 3. Indexing & Slicing (like dataset access)

```python
print(arr[0])      # 1
print(mat[1, 1])   # 4
print(arr[1:3])    # [2,3]
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Access **specific features/labels** from datasets.
* Slice batches of data for training.

🔸 **Mini Challenge:**

* Slice the last column of a 3×3 matrix.
* Extract the first two rows of a 4×4 matrix.

---

⏳ **Morning Wrap-up (12 PM)**
👉 You now understand NumPy arrays, shapes, and slicing — the **core building blocks** of all AI/ML code.

---

## **Superpowers: Transformations & Broadcasting**

---

### 4. Reshaping Arrays

```python
x = np.arange(6)  # [0 1 2 3 4 5]
x = x.reshape(2,3)  # 2x3 matrix
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Reshape images (e.g., `28x28 → 784`) before feeding into models.
* Reshape weight matrices.

🔸 **Exercise:**

* Create a 1D array of 12 numbers and reshape into (3,4).

---

### 5. Broadcasting (automatic expansion 🚀)

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = 2
print(a * b)  # [2 4 6]
```

```python
mat = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
vec = np.array([1,2])
print(mat + vec)  # [[2 4],[4 6]]
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Normalize datasets (`x - mean` / `std`).
* Add biases in neural networks.

🔸 **Mini Challenge:**

* Subtract the mean of each row in a 3×3 matrix using broadcasting.

---

### 6. Vectorized Operations (FAST math 🚀)

```python
x = np.array([1,2,3,4])
print(x**2)     # [1 4 9 16]
print(np.exp(x))
print(np.log(x))
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Activation functions (`exp`, `log`, `sigmoid`)
* Feature scaling

🔸 **Exercise:**

* Apply `np.square` and `np.sqrt` on a vector `[1,4,9,16]`.

---

⏳ **Afternoon Wrap-up (4 PM)**
👉 You can now reshape, broadcast, and perform vectorized ops = **superpowers for handling datasets and model inputs**.

---

##  **Linear Algebra & ML Essentials**

---

### 7. Matrix Operations

```python
A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
B = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])

print(A + B)     # element-wise
print(A * B)     # element-wise
print(A @ B)     # matrix multiplication
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* `A @ B` = **neural network forward pass (weights × inputs)**.
* Dot products = **similarity measures** (cosine similarity in NLP).

🔸 **Mini Challenge:**

* Multiply a (2×3) matrix with a (3×2) matrix.

---

### 8. Transpose & Inverse

```python
print(A.T)       # transpose
print(np.linalg.inv(A))  # inverse
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Transpose → adjusting dimensions for multiplication.
* Inverse → solving linear systems, optimization problems.

🔸 **Exercise:**

* Transpose a (3×2) matrix.
* Find determinant of a 2×2 matrix.

---

### 9. Random Numbers (for ML experiments)

```python
np.random.rand(3,3)    # uniform [0,1]
np.random.randn(3,3)   # normal distribution
np.random.randint(0,10,(3,3))
```

✅ AI/ML Relevance:

* Initialize neural network weights.
* Generate synthetic data for testing.

🔸 **Challenge:**

* Create random dataset of shape (100, 5) for features and (100,) for labels.

---

### 10. Putting It All Together (Mini Project 🏆)

**Build a Tiny Linear Regression from Scratch (No ML Library!)**

```python
# y = Wx + b + noise
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
W = 2.0
b = 1.0
y = W * X + b + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# Compute predicted values
y_pred = W * X + b

# Mean Squared Error
mse = np.mean((y - y_pred)**2)
print("MSE:", mse)
```

✅ **This is literally what ML models do!**

* Create data → Apply linear function → Measure error → Optimize.

---

⏳ **Evening Wrap-up (9 PM)**
👉 You’ve touched **linear algebra, random data, and even built a mini ML model** with NumPy.

---
